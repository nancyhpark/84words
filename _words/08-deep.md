##Scriptures

**Deep calls unto deep** / At the sound of Your water spouts; / All Your waves and Your billows / Pass over me.
---_Psa. 42:7_

**He reveals the deep things and the hidden things**; / He knows what is obscured in the darkness, / And the light dwells with Him.
---_Dan. 2:22_

Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and does them, I will show you whom he is like. **He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep and laid a foundation on the rock**. And when a flood came, the river broke out against that house, yet it was not strong enough to shake it, because it had been built well.
---_Luke 6:47-48_

But as it is written, "Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man's heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him." But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit, **for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God**.
---_1 Cor. 2:9-10_

## Footnotes

**To realize and participate in the deep and hidden things God has ordained and prepared for us requires us not only to believe in Him but also to love Him**. To fear God, to worship God, and to believe in God (that is, to receive God) are all inadequate; to love Him is the indispensable requirement. To love God means to set our entire being—spirit, soul, and body, with the heart, soul, mind, and strength (Mark 12:30)—absolutely on Him, that is, to let our entire being be occupied by Him and lost in Him, so that He becomes everything to us and we are one with Him practically in our daily life. **In this way we have the closest and most intimate fellowship with God, and we are able to enter into His heart and apprehend all its secrets (Psa. 73:25; 25:14). Thus, we not only realize but also experience, enjoy, and fully participate in these deep and hidden things of God**.
---_1 Cor. 2:9, note 3_

Different from taught. To be taught is related to our mind; to have something revealed to us is related to our spirit. **To realize the deep and hidden things God has prepared for us, our spirit is more necessary than our mind**. When our entire being becomes one with God through loving Him in intimate fellowship, He shows us, in our spirit through His Spirit, all the secrets of Christ as our portion. This is to reveal the hidden things planned by His wisdom concerning Christ, which have never come up in man's heart.
---_1 Cor. 2:10, note 1_

---

**The spirit of man is the deepest part of man's being. It has the faculty to penetrate the innermost region of the things of man, whereas the mind of man is capable of knowing only superficial things**. So also, only the Spirit of God can know the deep things of God. The Corinthian believers had neglected the spirit of man and the Spirit of God, having turned instead to live in their mind by philosophy. Hence, this book shows that the proper experience of these two spirits is essential for the practice of the church life.
---_1 Cor. 2:11, note 1_

---

**Praise the Lord that we, those who have been born of God by His Spirit, have received the Spirit of God. Hence, we are well able to know the deep things of God**, which He has graciously given to us for our enjoyment.
---_1 Cor. 2:12, note 1_

## Ministry Exceprts

What is a root?…If all your spiritual life is exposed, you do not have any root. Are all your virtues before God manifested before man, or is there something more that is unknown to man? If all your experiences are manifested, then all your growth is upward; there is no downward growth. If this is the case, you are a person who has only leaves without root, and you are on shallow ground…. **The Christian who parades all his virtues before men and who does not have anything in the depth of his being has no root; he will not be able to stand in the day of trial and temptation…May God work in us so that we can take root downward**. _Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 37_: General Messages (1), Chapter 8, Section 1)

Hosea 14:5-7 mentions Lebanon three times: (1) the lily in contrast to Lebanon, (2) the olive tree in contrast to Lebanon, and (3) the vine in contrast to Lebanon. In the whole world, the trees with the deepest roots are the cedars of Lebanon. **We should go down and take root in the depths; we should direct our growth to the depths**. (_God's Overcomers_, Chapter 1, Section 2)

**The only way to become deeply rooted in Christ as the soil is to contact Him as the soil and to daily absorb the water in the Word**. The more we contact the soil and absorb the water, the more we shall grow. First we grow downward, then upward. After we have grown downward for a period of time, we shall automatically cease to walk in things other than Christ. Instead, **because we have been deeply rooted in Christ, we shall live, walk, act, and have our being in Christ.** (_Life-Study of Colossians_, Chapter 46, Section 4)

---

**We need to let the Word go deeper in us in a fine way, and we must also allow our being to sink deeper into the Word, also in a fine way. When we go along with the Word and the Word comes into our spirit, in our experience we shall have the root hairs. These root hairs will then absorb the life supply. Our experience testifies that when we go deeper into the Word and the Word enters deeper into us, into our spirit, we have a finer contact with the Word and receive life.** (_Life-Study of Exodus_, Chapter 59, Section 5)

If God removes our barriers and our outer man is dismantled, our spirit will be open to all men. Our spirit will be open to receive the spirits of all the brothers; it will touch and be touched by the spirits of all the brothers. We will touch the Body of Christ. We will be the Body of Christ; our spirits will be the Body of Christ. Psalm 42:7 says, **"Deep calls unto deep."** The "deep" is indeed calling the "deep." The "deep" within us is calling and yearning to touch the "deep" within others, and our "deep" is calling and yearning to touch the whole church's "deep." This is the fellowship of deep with deep. **It is the calling and responding between deep and deep. If our outer man is broken and our inner man released, we will touch the spirit of the church, and we will be more useful to the Lord.** (_The Breaking of the Outer Man and the Release of the Spirit_, Chapter 9, Section 6)

### Hymn 671

<pre>
1. Deep down into the depths of this Thy Name,  
    My God, I sink and dwell in calm delight;  
    Thou art enough however long the day,  
    Thou art enough however dark the night.

2. Thou art my God—the All-Sufficient One,

    With miracles of love and tender care

### Take Time to Absorb Him, s. 2

<pre>
2. Take time to absorb Him, to gain the supply,  
    That we may be watered and nourished thereby;  
    The deeper the roots spread, the deeper the flow,  
    And richer and higher within us He'll grow.
</pre>

### Hymn 1163

<pre>
1. He's the vine and we're the branches,
    We should e'er abide in Him,
    And let Him abide within us
    As the flow of life within.

        In the vine, in the vine,
        In the vine, in the vine,
        We would know Thee, Lord, more deeply,
        E'er abiding in the vine.

2. As we hear His instant speaking,
    He's the rich indwelling Word;
    To abide we must be faithful
    To the speaking that we've heard.

3. For 'tis here we know abiding
    In the real and deepest way;
    If we love our Lord completely,
    We would do whate'er He'd say.

4. Then His love abides within us,
    And in love abiding, we
    Know the joy of life-communion,
    Full and perfect harmony.

5. Oh, how precious this abiding,
    Oh, how intimate and sweet;
    As the fruit of life is added,
    And our joy is made complete
</pre>
