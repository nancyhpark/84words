##Scriptures

Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! / For your love is better than wine.
---_S.S. 1:2_

Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Jehovah: / I remember concerning you the kindness of your youth, / **The love of your bridal days, / When you followed after Me** in the wilderness, / In a land that was not sown.
---_Jer. 2:2_

And she stood behind Him at His feet weeping and began to wet His feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head, and **she kissed His feet affectionately and anointed them with the ointment**. ---_Luke 7:38_

You did not give Me a kiss, but **she, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing My feet affectionately**.

---_Rom. 8:15_

## Footnotes

According to vv. 2-3, the lover of Christ has obtained a part of Christ's love, but now she yearns for something more intimate. This indicates that the **very Christ in whom we believe is personal and affectionate toward us** , **and that****every believer's relationship with Christ must be personal and affectionate **(Mark 16:7 and note; John 13:23; 20:1-17; Gal. 2:20b). After believing in Christ to receive Him as the divine life (John 1:4, 12),** we need to love Christ in a personal and affectionate way that we may pursue Him and enjoy Him as our satisfaction** (1 Cor. 2:9 and note 3; 1 Tim. 1:14 and note 2).

The mentioning of love here indicates that God's intention in giving His law to His chosen people was that they become His lovers (Deut. 6:5; Matt. 22:35-38; Mark 12:28-30). In bringing His people out of Egypt and giving His law to them, God was courting them, wooing them, and seeking to win their affection. Jeremiah 2:2; 31:32; and Ezekiel 16:8 indicate that the covenant enacted at the mountain of God through the giving of the law (24:7-8; 34:27-28) was an engagement covenant, in which God betrothed the children of Israel to Himself (cf. 2 Cor. 11:2). The Ten Commandments, especially the first five, gave the terms of the engagement between God and His people. The highest function of the law is to bring God's chosen people into oneness with Him, as a wife is brought into oneness with her husband (cf. Gen. 2:24; Rev. 22:17). In order for God and His people to be one, there must be a mutual love between them (John 14:21, 23). **The love between God and His people unfolded in the Bible is primarily like the affectionate love between a man and a woman (Jer. 2:2; 31:3). As God's people love God and spend time to fellowship with Him in His word, God infuses them with His divine element, making them one with Him as His spouse, the same as He is in life, nature, and expression** (Gen. 2:18-25 and notes).

Abba is an Aramaic word, and Father is the translation of the Greek word Pater. Such a term was used first by the Lord Jesus in Gethsemane while He was praying to the Father (Mark 14:36). The combining of the Aramaic title with the Greek title expresses a stronger affection in crying to the Father. **Such an affectionate cry implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father.**
---_Gal 4:6, note 4_

## Ministry Exceprts

The entire Bible is a divine romance. This means that the Bible is a very romantic book. This is true in particular of Song of Songs. Certain modernists doubt whether Song of Songs should be included in the Bible. Even some proper Christian teachers have had doubts about this book. When I was young, I also wondered why such a book is in the Bible, a book concerned with a romance between a man and a woman. This book is a portrait of the love relationship between us and Christ. According to Song of Songs, our relationship with the Lord should be very romantic. If there is no romance between us and the Lord Jesus, then we are religious Christians, not romantic Christians. If you wish to know what I mean by romance, I would encourage you to read and pray-read Song of Songs **. Pray-reading this book of romance will cause you to become romantic with the Lord. You will be beside yourself with love for Him. The Bible is a divine romance, and our relationship with the Lord should become more and more romantic**(_Life-Study of Exodus_, Chapter 5).

John Nelson Darby, who lived to be eighty-four and never married, **had such a love full of affection**. One night in his old age, he was staying alone in a hotel, and at bedtime he said, "Lord, I still love You." When I read about this, I was **deeply touched, desiring to have such an affectionate love for the Lord Jesus**. Now I can testify that, as an elderly person, I love Him much more than I did when I was young. **Recently I had a time of intimate, affectionate prayer to the Lord regarding a certain matter, and in my prayer I told Him, "Lord Jesus, I love You." As I was praying, I fell in love with the Lord Jesus once again** (_Life-Study of Psalms_, Chapter 20).

The apostle John could lie on the Lord's bosom (John 13:23). How personal and affectionate that was! The very God, the very Lord whom we seek, sets up a feast and invites us to feast with Him (Rev. 3:20). **We must have such a personal and affectionate contact with Him.** If we mail someone a letter, that affects him in a certain way. **But if we come to him with a personal visitation and an affectionate contact, that makes a great difference** (_Crystallization-Study of Song of Songs_, Chapter 1).

### Hymn 556, ss. 1-3

<pre>
1. Thy name is sweet as ointment poured forth;
    Better Thy love than wine, O draw Thou me!
    If we the footsteps follow of the flock,
    Entered Thy fellowship of love we'll be.

2. He's my Beloved, I am His own love;
    He draweth me, pursue I after Him.
    Fragrant as myrrh, I'd hide Him in my heart;
    Beauteous as henna, I'd be clothed with Him;

3. Bathe in His love, and of His fatness taste,
    Lie on His breast, His sweetness there enjoy;
    His love the banner, His affection shown
    Tenderly soothes my heart to purest joy.

### The Divine Romance, s. 4

<pre>
4. Lord, in this close sweet fellowship,  
    Lord, be with me so intimate,  
    So personal and affectionate;  
    A sweet relationship.

    Lord, daily change my inward being  
    Lord, all my heart possessing  
    In all my beingâ€”transforming  
    To be Your bride and queen.

        In Your love I'm drawn,  
        To You I belong;  
        I am not my own, Lord,  
        I'm Yours alone.

        By Your love I'm drawn,  
        In Your name I'm charmed,  
        And Your Person captured me,  
        For I've been kissed by Thee.
