## Scriptures

Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but **you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.** I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you. In that day you will know that **I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.**
---_John 14:17-18, 20_

To whom God willed to make known what are **the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you,** the hope of glory,
---_Col. 1:27_

That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed **our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ**.
---_1 John 1:3_

Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and we are. Because of this **the world does not know us,** because it did not know Him.
---_1 John 3:1_

And he who keeps His commandments **abides in Him**, and He in him. And in this we know that **He abides in us**, **by the Spirit** whom He gave to us.
---_1 John 3:24_

## Footnotes

The Greek word means joint participation, common participation. Fellowship is the issue of the eternal life and is actually the flow of the eternal life within all the believers, who have received and possess the divine life. It is illustrated by the flow of the water of life in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 22:1). All genuine believers are in this fellowship (Acts 2:42). It is carried on by the Spirit in our regenerated spirit. Hence, it is called "the fellowship of the Holy Spirit" (2 Cor. 13:14) and "fellowship of [our] spirit" (Phil. 2:1). It is in this fellowship of the eternal life that we, the believers, participate in all that the Father and the Son are and have done for us; that is, we enjoy the love of the Father and the grace of the Son by virtue of the fellowship of the Spirit (2 Cor. 13:14). Such a fellowship was first the apostles' portion in their enjoyment of the Father and the Son through the Spirit. Hence, in Acts 2:42 it is called "the fellowship of the apostles," and in this verse "our [the apostles'] fellowship," a fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. **It is a divine mystery. This mysterious fellowship of the eternal life should be considered the subject of this Epistle.**
---_1 John 1:3, note 3, par. 1_

Or, on this account, for this reason. **Because we are the children of God by a mysterious birth with the divine life, the world does not know us.**
---_1 John 3:1, note 5_

This verse is the conclusion of this section, which begins in 2:28, on our abiding in the Lord according to the teaching of the divine anointing, as unfolded in the preceding section (2:20-27). This section reveals that abiding in the Lord is the living of the children of God by His eternal life as the divine seed (vv. 15, 9, and note 297 in ch. 2), which grows in the practicing of the righteousness of their begetting God (2:29; 3:7, 10) and the love of their begetting Father (vv. 10-11, 14-23). **Such an abiding and its bases—the divine birth and the divine life as the divine seed—are mysterious yet real in the Spirit.**
---_1 John 3:24, note 1_

## Ministry Excerpts

**We have seen that the Spirit has been consummated and that Christ has become the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ. Thus, we may now speak of the divine and mystical realm of this consummated Spirit and of this pneumatic Christ. What a marvelous realm this is!**

We have pointed out that the three of the Divine Trinity are self-existing, ever-existing, and coinhering, and as such **the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are a divine and mystical realm.** With the Triune God Himself as a mystical realm there are no "complications," but in **the divine and mystical realm of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ there are a number of "complications," all of which are blessings to us.**

God wanted us to be in Him. If He were merely the Triune God without Christ's humanity, death, and resurrection, and we could enter into Him, we would find the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, but nothing of humanity, death, and resurrection. However, **when we enter into the divine and mystical realm of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ, we have not only divinity but also the humanity of Christ, the death of Christ with its effectiveness, and the resurrection of Christ with its repelling power. Everything is here in this wonderful realm.**

Although I was born in China and have become a naturalized American citizen, I can testify that I do not have the feeling that I am either Chinese or American. My realm is not China or America—my realm is the complicated and complicating Triune God. **I am here with the Father, with the Son, who was crucified and resurrected, and with the consummated Spirit. Since I am in such a Triune God, I have whatever I need. If I need crucifixion, I find that in this realm I have been crucified already. If I need resurrection, in this realm I have been resurrected already. Praise the Lord for such a divine and mystical realm!**

If we had been there when the Lord Jesus spoke about believing into God and into Him, we might have said, "Lord, I want to enter into You. Tell me how to believe into You **." As the following verses reveal, for us to enter into Him He had to die and be resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit, that we may receive Him by believing into Him and calling, "O Lord Jesus."** (_The Divine and Mystical Realm_, Chapter 3, Section 5)

The first Comforter was Christ in the flesh, and the other Comforter is the Spirit of reality. The "He" who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17 becomes the "I" who is the Lord Himself in verse 18. **This means that the Christ who was in the flesh went through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ. This is not merely spiritual—it is mystical.** We cannot say that the Spirit of reality is spiritual and the Christ who was in the flesh was not spiritual, for when He was in the flesh Christ the Son was surely spiritual. **What we need to see here is not something that is spiritual only but something mystical.**

Let us now read all of [John 14:] 20: "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you **." This refers to the divine and mystical realm where not only the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are but also where the believers are. Praise the Lord that, as believers in Christ, we are now in the divine, mystical realm of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ!**

**We all need to enter into the divine and mystical realm, not of the Triune God, but of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ (Phil. 1:19; Rom. 8:9; 2 Cor. 3:17-18)** (_The Divine and Mystical Realm_, Chapter 3, Section 6)

### Hymn 782, ss. 1-4

<pre>
1. How mysterious, O Lord,
    That Thy Spirit dwells in mine;
    O how marvelous it is,
    Into one, two spirits twine.

2. By the spirit I can walk,
    Spiritual in spirit be;
    By the spirit I can serve,
    And in spirit worship Thee.

3. Thru Thy Word and by my prayer
    In the spirit touching Thee,
    Lifted high my spirit is,
    Strengthened shall my spirit be.

4. Make my spirit strong I pray
    Others' spirits to revive;
    Lift my spirit high and free,
    Others' spirits then may thrive.
