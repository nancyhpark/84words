##Scriptures

The king has **brought me into his chambers**.
---_S.S. 1:4b_

**A garden enclosed** is my sister, my bride, / **A spring shut up, a fountain sealed**.
---_S.S. 4:12_

And he will be like a tree transplanted beside water, **/ Which sends out its roots by a stream**, / And will not be afraid when heat comes; / For its leaves remain flourishing, / And it will not be anxious in the year of drought / And will not cease to bear fruit.
---_Jer. 17:8_

**But you, when you pray, enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret**; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.
---_Matt. 6:6_

That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that **you, being rooted and grounded in love,**
---_Eph. 3:17_

He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, **to him I will give of the hidden manna**, and to him I will give a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no one knows except him who receives it.
---_Rev. 2:17_

## Footnotes

Through His death and resurrection Christ, as the last Adam, a man in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17). **As the all-inclusive consummated Spirit He visits us in our spirit privately, coming to us in a spiritual way, not in a physical way**.
---_S.S. 1:4, note 2, par. 2_

---

Through her living in Christ's ascension as the new creation in resurrection for her growth in life and transformation by life, Christ's transformed bride becomes mature in the riches of the life of Christ so that she becomes four things: a garden to satisfy Christ (4:12—5:1; 6:2-3), God's dwelling place with its protection (6:4a), the heavenly bodies as the universal light (6:10a), and a terrible army, which is the corporate overcomer—the Shulammite (6:4b, 10b, 13, and notes). **Here the garden is enclosed, and there is a spring shut up, a fountain sealed, for Christ's private enjoyment, indicating that in experiencing Christ we, the seeking believers, must have something private, hidden, shut up, and sealed that is for Christ alone.** The spring is the Spirit of life and is seen in Rev. 22:1 as the river of water of life. The fountain is the source of the spring, which is God's throne.
---_S.S. 4:12, note 1_

---

**The kingdom people must have some experience of praying in their private room, through which they contact their heavenly Father in secret, experience some secret enjoyment of the Father, and receive some secret answer from Him.**
---_Mat 6:6, note 1_

---

We are God's cultivated land and God's building (1 Cor. 3:9). As God's cultivated land, **we need to be rooted for our growth, and as God's building, we need to be grounded for our building up.**
---_Eph 3:17, note 3_

---

To experience Christ we need faith and love (1 Tim. 1:14). Faith enables us to apprehend Christ, and love enables us to enjoy Him. Neither faith nor love are ours; they are His. His faith becomes our faith, by which we believe in Him, and His love becomes our love, by which we love Him. **When we are rooted and grounded in His love, we grow and are built up in His life.**
---_Eph 3:17, note 4_

---

Manna is a type of Christ as the heavenly food that enables God's people to go His way. A portion of manna was preserved in a golden pot concealed in the Ark (Exo. 16:32-34; Heb. 9:4). The open manna was for the Lord's people to enjoy in a public way; the hidden manna, signifying the hidden Christ, is a special portion reserved for His overcoming seekers, who overcome the degradation of the worldly church. **While the church goes the way of the world, these overcomers come forward to abide in the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, where they enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion for their daily supply**. This promise is being fulfilled today in the proper church life and will be fulfilled in full in the coming kingdom. If we seek the Lord, overcome the degradation of the worldly church, and enjoy a special portion of the Lord today, He as the hidden manna will be a reward to us in the coming kingdom. If we miss Him as our special portion today in the church life, we will surely lose the enjoyment of Him as a reward in the coming kingdom.
---_Rev 2:17, note 2_

## Ministry Exceprts

**We each need to consider whether we spend even ten or fifteen minutes each day to be with the Lord privately. Many of us do not spend even a short time with the Lord. Recently, I have discovered that many saints only come to the meetings and have fellowship with other saints but do not have a personal, private, direct contact with the Lord**. This is a great lack. If this is our case, it is truly difficult for us to practically abide in the Lord. Coming to the meetings surely helps us with some things, but according to my experience, coming to the meetings does not help us to contact the Lord directly that we may actually abide in the Lord. **To abide in the Lord in a practical way requires a personal, private, direct contact with the Lord**. (_Crucial Principles for the Proper Church Life_, Chapter 1, Section 1)

We have been the Lord's children many years; may the Lord open our eyes and show us the extent to which our experiences have been hidden from public view. How much would be left if what is known by man was taken away? **May God work in us so that we can take root downward**. _(Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 37: General Messages (1),_ Chapter 8, Section 1)

What is a root? In a tree, the part that can be seen is the trunk, while the part beneath the ground, which cannot be seen, is the root. The branches have life and are visible; the roots are invisible. The roots are buried in the earth. Therefore, the roots refer to the _hidden life._ Those who do not have any root before the Lord will be dried up in their life…Brothers and sisters, let me ask you honestly, is your living only what is seen by men? Do you have any secret life before the Lord, inside your own room? If your prayers can only be heard in the prayer meetings, if you only read your Bible to others, and if your works are all before men, you do not have any roots. Do you know what the roots are? The roots are the parts that cannot be seen, that are hidden, and that are in secret… **If you do not have a secret or hidden life before God and if you do not have any secret prayer, reading, or obedience, I can say very frankly that you do not have any roots…Nothing can preserve you as much as a hidden life...Your spiritual life depends very much on your hidden life before God**. If you cannot sustain a hidden life, you will be weak before the Lord. Therefore, you should realize the importance of the hidden life.

**The shutting of the door in Matthew is a kind of root life**. What did the Lord say in verse 6:6? He said that when we pray, we should enter into a private room, shut the door, and pray to the Father who is in secret, and the Father who sees in secret will repay us. The Lord is very particular; He said that the Father will _see_ us in secret. Prayer is something that can be seen. We have always thought that prayer is something that is heard; however, the Lord did not say that prayers are heard, but that prayers are seen. Many times when we have no words before the Lord, our attitude alone is precious enough, because God is seeing and not just hearing us. Brothers and sisters, how much of what we are can be seen before God? How much of our living can be seen by God? How many times are we only seen by the Lord and no one else? Or are we doing everything in front of men?…How much of our lives are spiritual before God and have never been told to men?...How many of our things are kept exclusively for God's enjoyment? If we do not have anything like this, I can honestly say that we do not have any roots. **If we do not have a hidden spiritual life and have not been dealt with by God or smitten by Him in a hidden way, everything will be superficial and of no account**. (_God's Overcomers,_ Chapter 6, Section 2)

2. Take time to behold Him,
    The world rushes on;
