##Scriptures

Let him kiss me with **the kisses of his mouth**! / For your love is better than wine.
---_S.S. 1:2_

And **Jehovah would speak to Moses face to face, just as a man speaks to his companion**. And Moses would return to the camp, but his attendant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart out of the tent.
---_Exo. 33:11_

My servant Moses is not so; / He is faithful in all My house. 8a With him **I speak face to face**, even openly, and not in riddles; / And he beholds the form of Jehovah.
---_Num. 12:7_

But as it is written, "Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man's heart; **things which God has prepared for those who love Him**." 
---_1 Cor. 2:9_

## Footnotes

Psalms 135—139 were written from different directions to express the sentiments of the psalmists before God. These psalms reveal that the writers were very close to God and were concerned for God's interests. **The psalmists must have been persons who were soaked with God and who were in the divine presence. Only in this way could they have been qualified to write such intimate psalms to the One whom they loved. Like the writers of these psalms, we should aspire to be those who are intimate with God and who live and walk not only in God's presence but even in God Himself** (1 John 4:15-16).
---_Psa 135:1, note 2, par. 2_

The kisses of the mouth are the most intimate kisses. This yearning to be kissed by Christ is a response to Christ's cheering love, which is better than wine (v. 2b), and to His charming name (equivalent to His person), which is like ointment (the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit as the realization of Christ's person—1 Cor. 15:45; Exo. 30:23-25 and note 251) poured forth with the pleasant fragrance of the anointing oils (v. 3a). No one can resist Christ's cheering love and His charming person (cf. Matt. 4:18-20).

**According to vv. 2-3, the lover of Christ has obtained a part of Christ's love, but now she yearns for something more intimate. This indicates that the very Christ in whom we believe is personal and affectionate toward us, and that every believer's relationship with Christ must be personal and affectionate** (Mark 16:7 and note; John 13:23; 20:1-17; Gal. 2:20b). After believing in Christ to receive Him as the divine life (John 1:4, 12), we need to love Christ in a personal and affectionate way that we may pursue Him and enjoy Him as our satisfaction (1 Cor. 2:9 and note 3; 1 Tim. 1:14 and note 2).
---_S.S. 1:2, note 1_

To realize and participate in the deep and hidden things God has ordained and prepared for us requires us not only to believe in Him but also to love Him. To fear God, to worship God, and to believe in God (that is, to receive God) are all inadequate; to love Him is the indispensable requirement. To love God means to set our entire being—spirit, soul, and body, with the heart, soul, mind, and strength (Mark 12:30)—absolutely on Him, that is, to let our entire being be occupied by Him and lost in Him, so that He becomes everything to us and we are one with Him practically in our daily life. **In this way we have the closest and most intimate fellowship with God, and we are able to enter into His heart and apprehend all its secrets** (Psa. 73:25; 25:14). Thus, we not only realize but also experience, enjoy, and fully participate in these deep and hidden things of God.
---_1 Cor. 2:9, note 3_

---

Different from taught. To be taught is related to our mind; to have something revealed to us is related to our spirit. To realize the deep and hidden things God has prepared for us, our spirit is more necessary than our mind. **When our entire being becomes one with God through loving Him in intimate fellowship, He shows us, in our spirit through His Spirit, all the secrets of Christ as our portion**. This is to reveal the hidden things planned by His wisdom concerning Christ, which have never come up in man's heart.
---_1 Cor. 2:10, note 1_

---

**To have fellowship with God is to have intimate and living contact with Him in the flow of the divine life according to the Spirit's anointing in our spirit** (2:27). This keeps us in the participation and enjoyment of the divine light and the divine love.
---_1 John 1:6, note 1_

## Ministry Exceprts

**I have learned from experience how good it is to be intimate with the Lord and one with Him**. Sometimes we should not first speak to Him. We should let the Lord speak first. When He speaks, we should not immediately speak in return. **This means that we and the Lord should be like friends who take time to listen to each other**. Suppose a friend visits you and begins to speak to you about certain things. If you interrupt him and begin to speak about other matters, that would indicate that you do not care for what he is saying. That is not the way for intimate friends to converse together. **The proper way is that your friend talks to you, and you listen. Then, after a period of time, he will give you an opportunity to speak, and he will listen**. It certainly would not be proper for him to do all the talking and then, when he is finished, to say goodbye and leave. He should give you the opportunity to speak to him. This should also be true of our relationship with the Lord (_Life-Study of Exodus,_ Chapter 146).

---

In the Father's presence we not only enjoy grace, the expression of love, but we also enjoy love itself. **We experience this love in a very intimate way. Because we enjoy the love of God in such an intimate way, we do not want to do anything that displeases the Father**. The Father hates fornication, uncleanness, and lust. If we walk in love, we shall stay away from such things. Because we love the Father, we shall not do anything to grieve His heart. What a tender, delicate walk this is! This is not simply living by grace; it is walking in love. We should always remember that we are children of God enjoying His love. We are saints separated unto Him and saturated with Him. Therefore, in our daily walk **we would always take care of the Father's feeling, for we live intimately in His tender love** (_Life-Study of Ephesians,_ Chapter 50).

### Just One Touch ss. 1-3

<pre>
1. Just one touch of You, dear Lord,  
    Just one look into Your eyes,   
    Just one kiss from You,  
    You're all I need, my Love.

    Let me hear again Your voice.  
    You are now my final choice.  
    Speak in love to me.  
    I'll waste myself on Thee.

        Nothing and no one can satisfy me   
        but You anymore.  
        Jesus, I love You, my only desire.  
        Oh Lord, I just love You.

2. Let me touch You as before,  
    Craving for You more and more,  
    You're the very best!  
    I'll drop the rest for You.

    Oh, the kisses of Your mouth  
    Make my lips to praise and shout.  
    Lord, You're full of grace  
    Oh, what a taste my Love!

        Nothing and no one can satisfy me  
        but You anymore.  
        Jesus, my first Love, oh set me on fire  
        For You, my only desire.

3. Just infuse me with Your eyes.  
    Oh! This union satisfies!  
    As I gaze on You.  
    I'm filled with You, my Love.

    Only You alone will do.  
    I can't make it without You.  
    Keep me close to You,  
    Just joined to You as one.

        Nothing and no one can satisfy me  
        but You anymore.  
        Jesus, I love You, my only desire.  
        Oh, set my heart on fire.

### Hymns, #1159, ss. 1, 4

<pre>
1. Jesus Lord, I'm captured by Thy beauty,
    All my heart to Thee I open wide;
    Now set free from all religious duty,
    Only let me in Thyself abide.

    As I'm gazing here upon Thy glory,
    Fill my heart with radiancy divine;
    Saturate me, Lord, I now implore Thee,
    Mingle now Thy Spirit, Lord, with mine.

4. My Beloved, come on spices' mountain;
    How I yearn to see Thee face to face.
    Drink, dear Lord, from my heart's flowing fountain,
    Till I rest fore'er in Thine embrace.

    Not alone, O Lord, do I adore Thee,
    But with all the saints as Thy dear Bride;
    Quickly come, our love is waiting for Thee;
    Jesus Lord, Thou wilt be satisfied.
